## Why yubaba?

`yubaba` is as much of a _platform_ as it is an **orchestrator**.
It comes with prebuilt animations you can drop in and start using immediately,
such as [ConcealMove](/conceal-move) and [RevealMove](/reveal-move)!

But even better you can create _custom_ animations!
Using the same [internals](/collector) the [prebuilt animations use](https://github.com/madou/yubaba/tree/master/packages/yubaba/src/animations),
it comes with a first class customization experience for you to do,
well,
anything!

## Installation

```bash
npm install yubaba emotion --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add yubaba emotion
```

## Usage build ups

We'll build up each step to leave you with an _awesome_ transition.
Click each gif to see its codesandbox.

We have two disjointed components that are toggled when clicked (click on Finn!).
How can we transition them to each other?

**Introducing Baba and CrossFadeMove**

Let's use the [Baba](/baba) and [CrossFadeMove](/cross-fade-move) components to have them seamlessly transition to the destination.
[Baba](/Baba) is the brains - it does all of the orchestration.
[CrossFadeMove](/cross-fade-move) is one of many focal animations available - it will cross fade both elements from the starting point to the destination point.

Okay so that looks cool,
but Finn's sword is shown immediately!
Is there anything we can do to make it show after all animations have finished?

**Introducing BabaManager**

Let's bring in a component [BabaManager](/baba-manager) which will be used to delay showing Finn's sword.
You can imagine this as content in a page around the destination element that should be shown _after_ all animations have finished.

Cool,
now we're making progress.
We can do better though,
what if Finn could really sell his preparation that he's about to attack?

**Introducing CircleExpand**

Let's bring in a component [CircleExpand](/circle-expand) which will expand to fit the viewport,
for Finn it will give him some _oomph_ to really sell the attack.

Really cool!
But both the [CircleExpand](#circle-expand) and [CrossFadeMove](#cross-fade-move) happening at the same time looks kind of weird,
what if we could delay [CrossFadeMove](#cross-fade-move) until after [CircleExpand](#circle-expand) had finished animating?

**Introducing Wait**

Let's bring in a component [Wait](/wait) which will delay the next animation from happening until after the previous one has finished!

And there you have it,
a masta-peece!
