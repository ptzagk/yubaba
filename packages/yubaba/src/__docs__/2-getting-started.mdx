# Getting started

At `yubaba`'s core is animations.
We can build up a great user experience by selecting a handful of animations to compose with each other to seamlessly transition views from one state to another.

Let's work together to animate this image search.

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

## Moving an element

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

## Delay showing content until all animations have finished

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>
