# Troubleshooting

## Animations aren't starting

Sometimes a [Baba](/baba) element is reused by React if the markup where the [Baba](/baba) element was rendered didn't change.
To get around this you can use [React `key` prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) to force each [Baba](/baba) to re-mount.

## TypeError: Cannot read property 'getBoundingClientRect' of undefined

Your target `ref` is probably not being set correctly.
Double check your [Baba](/baba) elements.
