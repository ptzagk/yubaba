# Advanced usage

## Using supporting animations

We can do so much more than just move with `yubaba`,
we can build a great user experience by selecting a handful of animations to compose with each other to seamlessly transition views from one state to another.

One extra tool in our toolbox is using [CircleExpand] and [CircleShrink] to transition content around

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

## Delay showing content until all animations have finished

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

## Wait for the previous animation to finish before starting the next

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

## Moving using a focal target

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

## Animating over route transitions

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>
