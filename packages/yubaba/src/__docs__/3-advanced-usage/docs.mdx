# Advanced usage

## Delay showing content until all animations have finished

Occasionally when initiating an animation we can have some secondary content we want to keep hidden until the animation has finished.
Luckily [BabaManager](/baba-manager) exists to do just that!
Make it a parent of any [Baba](/baba) and it will show its content only when the animation has finished.

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

> **Tip -** If you have multiple child [Baba](/baba) you can pass [BabaManager](/baba-manager) a `name` prop to target a specific [Baba](/baba).

## Using supporting animations

While movement is a large part of `yubaba` we can do so much more!
When building a great user experience its also useful to have supporting animation to help seamlessly transition from one state to another.

Two extra tools we have to do this is [CircleExpand](/circle-expand) and [CircleShrink](/circle-shrink) animations,
used together can produce a really cool transition between states.

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

> **Tip -** The `container` prop has been used to target the example area,
> generally you only need to use this if you have a particular area you want to use for secondary animations.

## Wait for the previous animation to finish before starting the next

Depending on the animations chosen you'll want to defer starting one until the previous has finished.
Luckily the [Wait](/wait) component has been made for that!

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>

> **Tip -** Animations are executed from top to bottom.
> The parent-most animation will be executed first and then continue execution inwards.

## Moving using a focal target

At times we want to move all content at once but have it originate from a focal point.
The [FocalTarget](/focal-target) component exists to mark the focal element so animations who care can use it.
Two examples of animations who can use it are [Expand](/expand) and [ExpandMove](/expand-move).

<Playground>
  <Toggler>{toggler => 'TODO'}</Toggler>
</Playground>
