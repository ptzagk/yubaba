# yubaba

is an element animation orchestrator for React.js âœ¨

## Why yubaba?

`yubaba` is as much of a _platform_ as it is an **orchestrator**.
It can control when, where, and how to start animations and comes with prebuilt animations you can drop in and start using immediately,
such as [ConcealMove](/conceal-move) and [RevealMove](/reveal-move)!

Even better you can create _custom_ animations!
Using the same [internals](/collector) the [prebuilt animations use](https://github.com/madou/yubaba/tree/master/packages/yubaba/src/animations),
it comes with a first class customization experience for you to do,
well,
anything!

## Installation

`yubaba` has a peer dependency on [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) - make sure to use the latest for the best performance.

```bash
npm install yubaba emotion --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add yubaba emotion
```
