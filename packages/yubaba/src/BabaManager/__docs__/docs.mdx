# BabaManager

Used to hide contents before an animation is complete triggered from a child [Baba](/baba) component.
If there is more than one child [Baba](/baba) you can use an optional name prop which should match the appropriate [Baba](/baba) component.

If it is the initial mount it will immediately be shown.

> **Tip -** See [Delay showing content until all animations have finished](/advanced-usage#delay-showing-content-until-all-animations-have-finished) for more information on how to use this component.
