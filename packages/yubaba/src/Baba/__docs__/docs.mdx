# Baba

This is the primary component in yubaba.
When rendering it will be given all of the animation data from its children.
When unmounting or flipping the "in" prop from `true` to `false`,
it will execute all the animations `top to bottom` if a matching [Baba](#baba) pair is found within `50ms`.

## Usage

<Playground>// TODO</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable of={Baba} />
