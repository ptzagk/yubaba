# Baba

This is the primary component in yubaba.
When rendering it will be given all of the animation data from its children.
When unmounting or flipping the `in` prop from `true` to `false`,
it will execute all the animations **top to bottom** if a matching Baba pair is found within `50ms`.

> **Tip -** See [Getting started](/getting-started) for more information on how to use this component.
